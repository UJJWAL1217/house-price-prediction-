# house-price-prediction-
This is my first small ML project . This project helps to predict the price of the houses based on some features . Their are 14 features in total you can see the features in the file"newbook" within the 1st row along with the data . I have found the parameters by analysing the graphs and the plots , that which among thm is affectinh the price at great extent . I have tried 4 models and calculated the error margin in each models accordingly and found that "random forest " is giving less error as compare to rest three . So i selected the Random forest ml model to predict my results . here you have to give the array of data accoedingly with features and the model will predict the price accordingly.
